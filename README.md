<h3 id="ch1-2">1.2 Overview of Web and Cloud Development</h3>

When you're starting out as a Web Developer, it can be difficult to
determine what you need to learn and what order you should learn it in.

Understanding how the websites that you're already familiar with are
constructed and delivered to you is a good starting point.

Let's review the basics of how you interact with a website:
<ol>
   <li>You launch an internet browser -- there are lots available:
   <ul>
      <li>Google Chrome,</li> <li>Microsoft Edge,</li> <li>Mozilla Firefox, and</li> <li>Apple Safari are
some of the most popular.</li>
</ul></li>
   <li>The browser has an address bar, into which you enter a URL, like
    www.IBM.com,</li>

   <li>The browser then contacts the server with the name and requests the
    information that makes up the website,</li>

   <li>The server then sends a response, which contains the data that the
    client requires to display the website,</li>

   <li>For most websites, the server will return:
   <ul>
      <li>HTML, which defines the structure of the page, but doesn't look very attractive,</li>
      <li>CSS, which adds styles and flair to the page and,</li>
      <li>JavaScript, which adds interactivity and dynamic content.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
</ol>
Content displayed by websites can contain elements that are either
previously stored on the server (called "static") or generated each time
they are requested by the client (called "dynamic").

Dynamic elements can involve information coming from other systems and
applications, such as databases.

Most websites contain static and dynamic elements to provide the best
user experience.

Cloud Applications are similar to Websites in that they request content
that a server returns.

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Cloud Apps are built to work seamlessly with a Cloud-based back-end
infrastructure, Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other
Cloud services, making them very scalable and very resilient.

The environment for building websites and Cloud Applications is divided
into two primary areas:

1.  The <b>front-end</b> deals with everything that happens
    at the client-side -- everything the user can see and interact with.

You can choose to specialize in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and related frameworks, libraries, and tools.

2.  The <b>back-end</b> deals with everything that happens on
    the server before the code and data are sent to the client.

The back-end coding usually handles the logic and functionality that
make the website or app work, and the authentication processes that keep
data secure.

Back-end developers may also work with relational or noSQL databases,
even collaborating with database administrators in bigger projects.

Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge, and experience in both
front-end and back-end environments.

Whichever way you choose to specialize, you will need the appropriate
tools to help you work.

The first tool most developers add to their resources is a code editor.

Developers also need tools to integrate, build, compile, and debug code.

Integrated Development Environments or IDEs incorporate some of these
additional capabilities beyond just code editing and make it easier to
build and manage your code.

Good IDEs support multiple languages and integrate with management and
storage tools like Git and GitHub.

Other useful features are custom extensions and themes for supporting
your working style and environment.

Examples for code editors and IDEs include Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS
Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse and NetBeans.

In this brief overview, you learned about:
<ul>
<li>The basic communication between client and servers,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>How websites are built and displayed,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Front-end development is about what happens on the client,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Back-end development is about what happens on the server,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Full-stack development incudes both front-end and back-end development,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>IDEs will help you create and manage your code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch1-3">1.3 Learning Front-End Development</h3>

Internet websites offer lots of different services, one of the most
popular being online shopping.

When you explore an online shopping website, navigating through pages,
choosing different product categories, or comparing products, you are
interacting with the front-end of a website.

Let us see how the front-end of a website is developed by front-end
developers.

For this, we need to understand how a website is made.

To create a website, web developers usually use Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.

These languages are designed to work in conjunction with each other.

HTML is used to create the physical structure of a website.

The physical structure contains elements such as text, links,
images/videos, page dividers and buttons.

The HTML code ensures a proper formatting of all text and image elements
so that browsers display the page consistently.

The backend developer codes the structure of the website.

A website is like a house which has only been constructed.

Just like we need interior designers to add style to a space, we need
front-end developers to add the necessary glamor and appeal to a
website.

When you order products from any website, you realize that the pages
have a pleasing font style, attractive colors and are easy to navigate.

Developers use CSS to create stylish websites.

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

CSS provides front-end developers with a standard method to define,
apply, and manage different sets of style characteristics for a website
and each of its components.

CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designs
and layouts.

HTML is used to create the structure and CSS is used to design it and
make it appealing.

CSS is also used to create websites that have cross browser
compatibility which means that they are compatible with multiple
browsers and multiple devices such as PC, mobile devices, iPads etc.

Online shopping websites are intuitive, interactive and quick to load.

This is where JavaScript comes into the picture.

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used in
conjunction with HTML and CSS to add interactivity to a website.

For example, you use HTML to add a login button to a page, and CSS to
style that button.

You then use JavaScript to add log-in functionality to that button.

A new front-end development language is Syntactically Awesome Style
Sheets (SAAS).

It is an extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.

SAAS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, and inline
imports to keep things organized.

SAAS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.

Another language that is being used now is Learner Style Sheets (LESS).

LESS enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions. It is backwards
compatible with CSS.

Less.js is a JavaScript tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS
styles.

Using all these languages, websites are designed as reactive and
responsive.

Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website
designed for a specific screen size.

For example, a website can provide more information if opened on a PC
than when opened on a mobile device.

Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize
to the device it is being accessed from.

For example, if you open up a products website on your mobile device, it
will adapt itself to the small size of the screen and still show you all
the features.

A JavaScript framework is an application framework that is written in
JavaScript.

Programmers can manipulate the different functions, use them wherever
required and can create device responsive applications.

A few examples of several frameworks being used are:
<ul>
<li><b><i>Angular framework</i></b> is an open-source framework and is being maintained by Google.<br/>
Angular frameworks allow websites to render the HTML pages quickly and
efficiently.<br/>
It has built-in tools for routing and form validation.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li><b><i>React.js</i></b> has been developed and maintained by Facebook.<br/>
It is a JavaScript library that builds and renders components for a web
page. It is not a complete suite of tools. For example, routing is not a
part of this framework and will need to be added using a third-party
tool.<br/>
React.js only helps build and drop components into a page.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li><b><i>Vue.js</i></b> is maintained by the community and its main focus is the view
layer which includes user interface, buttons, and visual components.<br/>
It is flexible, scalable and integrates well with other frameworks.<br/>
It is very adaptable -- it can be a library, or it can be the
framework.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.

The technologies are upgraded constantly and so front-end developers
needs to keep upgrading the websites that they create.

The websites that they create should work in multiple browsers, multiple
operating systems and multiple devices.

<h3 id="ch1-4">1.4 Introducing Application Development Tools</h3>

Welcome to Introducing Application Development Tools.

Getting your Cloud App from the ideas stage to fully formed, written,
and deployed is a long process, but there are many tools which will help
you along the way.

A cloud application developer's workbench includes:
<ul>
<li>Version Control,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Libraries, and<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Frameworks.</li>
</ul>
When many developers are working on the same project, knowing what order
changes were made, thereby creating a new version of the source code,
becomes overridingly important.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 07. version control (12) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image007.png"
   alt="Version Control"
   width="65%">
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Version control systems keep track of what changes were made when and by
whom and resolve any conflicts between changes.

For developing your code version control can be useful even when you are
the sole contributor on a project.

Properly used, it can give you a way to revert to an older version of
your code if something goes wrong and gives you some basic information
about how the code developed over time.

Version control functionality is generally tied to the storage system
you are using, which is why a code repository is recommended, even for
beginners.

Git and GitHub are extremely popular for source code storage and
management.

Git stores files in repositories where you can track changes, split code
into different branches for more focused development, and then merge
them back into the main body of code.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------- 08. libraries (13) --------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image008.png" 
   alt="Libraries"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Libraries are collections of code, like standard programs and
subroutines, which you can use within your code.

For example, you might want to include a navigational feature, like a
carousel -- a code library can supply you with the code for that so that
you don't have to spend the time and energy creating one from scratch.

Being able to reuse code in this way makes developing your app much
quicker and easier.

Multiple code libraries can be integrated into your existing project.

As you discover a need for a specific function or feature, you can
research an appropriate library.

You determine when to call the required method as needed, and control
returns to the program flow once the subroutine is finished.

When you use a code library, you are in control.

Code libraries are generally used to solve a specific problem or add a
specific feature set.

Either way, there are lots for you to choose from, so do your research.

Here are some examples of code libraries:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/image009.png"
   alt="Libraries: jQuery"
   width="20%" />
&nbsp;

-   jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies Dom manipulation.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/image010.png"
   alt="E-Mail Validator"
   width="20%" />
&nbsp;

-   Email-validator is a small library that checks an email address is
    correctly constructed and valid.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/image011.png"
   alt="Apache Commons Proper"
   width="20%" />
&nbsp;

-   Apache Commons Proper is a repository of reusable Java components.

Frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy applications.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------ 12. frameworks - scaffold to build apps (14) -------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image012.png"
   alt="Frameworks - the scaffold to build your apps"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can think of a framework as being a skeleton that you can extend by
adding your own code, providing a scaffold on which to build your apps.

The framework you intend to use must be determined early in your
development planning and used right from the beginning.

New frameworks can't be incorporated into an existing project.

Your chosen framework dictates the architecture of your program and
controls the program flow.

The framework determines which subroutines and methods will be called
when.

When working with a framework, there is a specific structure that you
must follow.

The framework is calling calls on your code, rather than you calling on
the framework.

Frameworks are less flexible than libraries, allowing you less control,
but they do provide good standardization and can help you create
efficient code.

To use an analogy, if you are a carpenter building a house, the
framework is the frame that you add to -- bricks on the outside,
plasterboard on the inside, and so on.

The frame acts as a guide for how the house is constructed.

Here are some examples of frameworks:

-   AngularJS is a JavaScript-based framework for dynamic web
    applications.

-   Vue.js is a JavaScript framework focused on the user interface.

-   Django is a framework that uses Python for web development.

Frameworks define the workflow that you must follow, unlike libraries,
which allow you to call functions as and when required.

When using a framework, it can sometimes feel like you, as a developer,
are not in full control of the development process.

This sense of the framework and its predefined workflow controlling the
development process is referred to as inversion of control.

Frameworks that have a lot of control are known as opinionated -- they
have opinions on how their workflow should be used and remove a lot of
the decisions you would otherwise have to make about how code is
written, the location of files, and even file names.

Frameworks often include their own libraries, which they call when
needed.

Inversion of control allows you to create standardized apps, and takes
away a lot of the tedious configuration work, so you can focus on the
code for your app.

In this last module, you've learned about some of the tools that you
will utilize in your career as a developer including:

-   Version control,

-   libraries,

-   frameworks

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

<h3 id="ch1-5">1.5 More Application Development Tools</h3>

Welcome to More Application Development Tools.

Let's look at some tools which can help you get your app built and
deployed:

CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages, and Package Managers.

CI/CD refers to the practices of continuous integration and either
continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

CI/CD is a best practice for devops teams enabling developers to deliver
frequent changes reliably.

Implemented through a build-automation server, Continuous Integration
(CI) ensures that all the code components work together smoothly.

A CI build environment enables you to integrate newly developed code
frequently, at least every day, if not every hour, depending on how
quickly the project changes.

Continuous delivery (CD) begins where CI ends. The CI process
automatically builds and tests your code, then CD deploys all code
changes in a build to a testing or staging environment.

A build tool transforms your source code into the binaries needed for
installation.

Build tools organize your source code, set compile flags, and manage
dependencies.

They are most important in environments where there are many
inter-connected projects, with multiple developers contributing to each
project.

In these environments it can be very difficult to keep track of what
changes were made, in what order, what dependencies exist, and what
needs to be incorporated in the next build, so automation is key to
keeping everything running smoothly.

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Build automation can automate a wide variety of tasks that developers do
in their day-to-day activities like:

-   Downloading dependencies.

-   Compiling source code into binary code.

-   Packaging that binary code.

-   Running tests.

-   Deployment to production systems.

You can initiate a build from the command line or from an IDE.

There are two categories of Build Tools widely in use:

1.  Build-automation utilities, which generate build artifacts like
    executables, by compiling and linking source code.

2.  Build-automation servers, which execute build-automation utilities
    on a scheduled or triggered basis.

Some examples of build tools are:

-   Webpack -- a module bundler for JavaScript

-   Babel -- a JavaScript compiler

Now that you have your app developed and tested, you're ready to deploy.

But how does that happen?

The app needs to be simple and trouble free for the user to install, so
a commonly used technique is to collect all the necessary files and
bundle them together into a package.

Packages are archive files that contain the app files, instructions for
installation, and any metadata that you choose.

They have their own metadata too, including the package description,
package version, and any dependencies, like other packages that need to
be installed beforehand.

Once you have bundled your app into a package, you can use a package
manager to distribute it.

Package managers take care of the tasks of finding, installing,
maintaining or uninstalling software packages at the user\'s request.

Package management systems:

1.  Coordinate with file archivers to extract package archives.

2.  Verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity
    and authenticity of the package.

3.  Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a
    software repository.

4.  Manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all
    packages it requires.

Some commonly used package managers for each of the major platforms are
listed here:

-   On Linux - Debian Package Management System (DPKG) and Red Hat
    Package Manager (RPM)

-   On Windows - Chocolatey

-   On Android - Package Manager

-   On MacOS - Homebrew and MacPorts

Any libraries that are used or utility code that is developed as part of
the application is managed with the cloud application package managers.

Here are some examples of package managers for popular languages:

-   For Node.js/Javascript - npm

-   For Java - Gradle and Maven

-   For Ruby - RubyGems

-   For Python - Pip and Conda

In this section, you've learned about some of the tools that you
will utilize will support you in your career as a developer , including:

<h3 id="ch1-6">1.6 The Importance of Back-End Development</h3>

Welcome to the importance of back-end development.

A front-end developer creates websites and Cloud applications, using
HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create what the user sees and interacts with
in the client software.

A back-end developer creates and manages all the resources that are
needed to respond to the requests that the user makes through the
client.

The back-end developer's tasks focus on enabling the server
infrastructure, or back-end, to process requests, supply data, and
provide other services securely.

Front-end and back-end developers must work together very closely.

Each needs to understand the requirements of the solution and how their
respective parts will interact before the development process can begin.

Throughout the lifecycle of the website or Cloud app, front-end and
back-end developers collaborate to resolve issues and add functionality.

How does the work of a back-end developer affect you as you are browsing
the internet or using a Cloud app?

Think about it like this: when you're shopping online, what happens to
the data you enter?

Your login information, your product searches, your payment info?

The back-end processes all these things, and the back-end developers
write and maintain the parts of the application that process the inputs.

Let's think about your experience as you explore an online shopping site
and make a purchase.

As you search for products, your search request is submitted to a web
application which then retrieves the data from a separate database and
serves it back to the client for display.

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

To facilitate this, a back-end developer must understand the language
that the web application uses, how to query the database for the correct
data, and how to bring the two together.

Even a simple task like navigating around the site can require the
skills of a back-end developer.

Many sites have restricted areas that are only available to users who
have an account and have logged in.

User account management, authentication and authorization can be the
responsibility of the back-end developer too.

Once you've decided what you want to purchase, you must add it to your
cart and make a payment.

The purchase process requires you to submit sensitive information, such
as your address and credit card number, and the back-end developer must
ensure that this data is securely handled and stored.

Front-end client interactions, whether a request for data like an image,
accepting input from a user filling out a form, or securing sensitive
information like a credit card number all require different services
from the back-end server.

Each request needs to interact with the back-end in a different way.

Back-end developers use APIs, routes, and endpoints to process incoming
requests:

An <b>API</b> is code that works with data, usually using
JSON or XML. APIs have set rules and structure.

A <b>route</b> is a path to a website or page that the user
interacts with.

Routes generally take user input and show results based on the input.

An <b>endpoint</b> may be an API or may simply be a path.

When a request from the front-end arrives at the back-end, it is routed
to the correct service.

If the backend has an end point defined for the request by using
routing, the request will be addressed and replied to.

If the end point is missing, the server returns a 404 error.

Back-end developers must create and maintain this server-side routing.

Along with backend APIs, routes effectively allow the front-end client
to plug into the correct socket at the back-end.

APIs provide a mechanism for Cloud apps, mobile apps, and other types of
software to access resources from the back-end.

To perform all this back-end development you will need to be familiar
with at least one back-end language, and its associated frameworks.

Among the most popular languages today is JavaScript, which was
originally designed to run in web browsers, adding extra interactivity
and dynamic content to web pages.

JavaScript is also being used on the back-end, with new releases adding
server-side functionality.

JavaScript has many frameworks, but two of the most well-known are
Node.js and Express.

Python is another popular language; it's very flexible and easy to
learn. Python has wide functionality -- it can be used for everything
from creating web pages to connecting to a database, to performing data
analysis.

Two well-known Python frameworks are Django and Flask.

Back-end developers often work with data and databases, so you will also
benefit from learning some SQL.

To help handle requests from databases, back-end developers can use
object-relational mapping tools (ORM) to connect to the database and
retrieve the correct data.

Although an ORM can hide some of the complexity of querying databases,
it's useful to understand the fundamentals of databases so that you can
troubleshoot any issues that arise.

The day-to-day tasks of a back-end developer focus on the behind the
scenes functionality that keeps websites, cloud apps and mobile apps up
and running.

Back-end development covers a wide range of technologies, from managing
user accounts, authentication and authorization to ensuring that
sensitive data is stored and transferred securely.

Back-end developers also work with databases, retrieving, processing and
storing data as required.

Life for a back-end developer is varied, challenging, and ever changing.

The most fundamental tools for front-end developers are the languages
they use for developing the website or app. Foremost among these is
HyperText Markup Language (HTML). A good understanding of HTML, its
features, support, and scripting capabilities, makes a solid foundation
on which to build your development skills. Once you have mastered
creating the basic structure of a website with HTML, you can add style
with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which enables you to make your
websites more attractive by adding a consistent style and design
throughout.

<h3 id="ch2-1">2.1 Introduction to HTML</h3>

Hello and welcome to Introduction to HTML.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain what Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and HTML5 is, and
    list the objectives of HTML5.

-   The core HTML specification includes this background information:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which can be thought of as
"the language of the Internet".

It is a markup language that was originally designed for sharing
scientific documents.

Adaptations to HTML over the years have made it suitable to describe a
number of other types of documents that can be displayed as web pages on
the Internet.

HTML Elements are the building blocks of an HTML page. The pieces of
content that form the page are assigned labels such as "paragraph,"
"list," and "table".

They are represented by tags.

Browsers do not display the tags but use them to render the content.

HTML has been in continuous evolution since it was introduced to the
Internet in the early 1990s by CERN:

The European Organization for Nuclear Research and the IETF: Internet
Engineering Task Force.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) made a number of recommendations to
the HTML standards over the years.

New features were continually added, and specifications changed over
time.

Initially, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
(WHATWG) worked on recommendations independently.

Then, in 2007, W3C formed a working group chartered to work with the
WHATWG on the development of the HTML5 specification.

The W3C published the specification under the W3C copyright, while a
version with a less restrictive license was kept on the WHATWG site.

Since 2007, both the W3C and WHATWG groups worked together on the
development of the HTML5 standard.

The HTML5 specification, as drafted by W3C, includes the following
objectives:

The HTML5 specification defines a single language called HTML5 that can
be written in HTML or XML syntax.

The HTML5 specification defines a processing model that can interoperate
with earlier HTML implementations.

HTML5 improves the markup for documents.

HTML5 includes markup and APIs for idioms, such as web storage, video,
and audio content.

When speaking about creating web pages, developers may use the terms
HTML and HTML5 interchangeably.

In general, the term HTML implies HTML5.

Use the full term HTML5 if you need to differentiate between versions,
such as when discussing features new to HTML5.

In this course, HTML refers to HTML5, unless specified otherwise.

In this section, you learned:

-   HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, a markup language that
    enables documents to be displayed as web pages on the Internet.

-   Tags represent the elements of an HMTL page like paragraphs, lists,
    and tables.

-   Pages written in HTML or XML syntax,

-   Interoperation with earlier HTML versions,

-   Markup and APIs for web storage, video, and audio content.

<h3 id="ch2-2">2.2 HTML Features</h3>

Hello and welcome to HTML Features.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   List some of the features of HTML5,

-   Describe the Document Object Model (DOM) tree,

-   Explain when you would use XML and when you would use HTML.

What are some HTML5 features?

-   It provides the means to categorize web pages into different
    sections, and includes tools for effective data management, drawing,
    video, and audio.

-   Facilitates the development of cross-browser applications for the
    web and portable devices.

-   Allows greater flexibility, permitting the development of exciting
    and interactive websites.

-   Helps to create a more engaging user experience. Pages that are
    designed by using HTML5 can provide an experience similar to desktop
    applications.

-   Allows for enhanced, multiple-platform development by combining the
    capability of an application programming interface (API).

By using HTML5, developers can create a modern application experience
that is uniform across platforms and devices.

<!----------------------------------- 13. html dom tree (26) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">

&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Here is an example of a document that conforms to the syntax of HTML5.

Documents that have the text/html media type are parsed using HTML
rules.

If a document is transmitted with an HTML content type, such as
text/html, it is processed as an HTML document by web browsers.

This example uses the following elements:

The <b>\<!DOCTYPE html\></b> is a declaration tag that represents the
document type.

The declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web
browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

Although this declaration is not required, it should be the first line
of the HTML code if the developer decides to include it.

The \<html\> ... \</html\> tag is the root element of this tree.

It contains all of the other HTML elements, except the \<!DOCTYPE html\>
declaration tag.

This example, contains two elements:  \<head\> and \<body\>.

The \<head\> tag contains a \<title\> in the example.

The \<head\> element can contain the following tags:

-   title ( 

-   scripts (

-   style (

-   style sheet links ( ),

-   meta information (),

-   browser support information and,

-   other initialization functions ().

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Finally, the \<body\> tag contains all content that is displayed on the
webpage.

HTML user agents, commonly known as browsers, parse the markup, turning
it into a DOM (Document Object Model) tree.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------- 14. dom tree - an in-memory representation of a document (28) ------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image014.png"
   alt="DOM Tree - an in-memory representation of a document"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.

DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, which include a DOCTYPE node,
elements such as headers and paragraphs, text nodes, and comment nodes.

Here is an example of a document that conforms to the XML syntax of
HTML5.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------- 15. xml example - an in-memory representation of a document (28) ------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image015.png"
   alt="XML Example Document"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents look similar to HTML
documents, except they have an XML tag on the first line.

In addition, with XML documents, the Content-type must be specified as
an XML media type such as application/xml.

When a document is transmitted with an XML content type, it is treated
as an XML document by a web browser and an XML processor parses the
document.

How do you decide whether to use HTML or XHTML for developing web pages?

Which of the two options you choose is related to how you intend to use
the application.

For instance, are you using XSLT (Extensible Style Sheet Language
Transformations) to create other documents and resources from your web
pages?

People are equally divided about whether to use XHTML or HTML.

Both HTML and XHTML use the same semantic (tags). However, XHTML tags
all need to be in <i>lowercase</i>, while the case used does not matter in
HTML.

In addition, XHTML must be well-formed.

Every element must have an end tag. All attributes must have a value and
double or single quotation marks must surround all attribute values.

If an XML parser encounters a situation where the syntax is not
well-formed, it stops processing.

In HTML, different case, unmatched quotation marks, and non-terminated
and uncontained elements are allowed and commonplace.

In this regard, HTML syntax is less rigorous than XHTML syntax.

In this section, you learned that HTML5 Includes features for
categorizing sections of web pages, and managing data, video and audio
tools.

Enables you to develop a single, cross-browser application for the web
and portable devices, helps you to create a more engaging user
experience.

The DOM tree is a representation of a document which is held in memory.

It contains nodes which define the type and structure of the document.

&nbsp;

The syntax it defines is compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1 documents.

HTML5 is defined in a way that it is compatible with earlier versions in
the way browsers handle deployed content.

It separates conformance requirements for user agents and authors. In
other words, how browsers treat HTML5 code and how page authors treat
HTML5 code is different.

For user agents, HTML5 is defined in a way that supports elements and
attributes of the earlier specifications.

For authors, several elements and attributes have been removed in order
to simplify the language.

</div>

HTML5 includes some elements and application programming interfaces that
help in the creation of web applications.

Examples include video and audio elements, and an API that supports the
creation of offline applications.

What do you think makes HTML suitable for creating web applications?
There are a number of possible reasons:

The range of devices that all have built-in browsers that support HTML5
features.

The number of APIs that enhance the user experience, such as the
advanced animation, drawings, audio, and video elements.

The efficient use of HTML and CSS, while reducing the number of images,
can lead to faster load times for rendering web pages.

Search engine optimizations can use keywords that are taken from HTML
attributes to improve the visibility of a website when search results
are displayed.

The meta tags shown are used to provide information to search engines.

Here are some examples of elements in HTML5.

-   New structural elements are part of the HTML5 specification. These
    markup elements help you to logically define the page structure.

-   New APIs such as canvas, audio, and video help with graphics and
    embedded content.

-   New attributes were added to the input element attributes.

-   Examples include the email, datetime, and number types.

-   The browser automatically validates the input field according to the
    input attribute, without the need for custom validation scripts.

-   By using web storage APIs, you can store data in the browser.

The web workers feature can be used for non-interactive processing. Web
workers provide a way to run processing-intensive tasks without blocking
the user interactions to the current page.

In this section, you learned about:

HTML5 Themes, which provide:

-   Syntax compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1,

-   New and refined APIs for video and audio elements, offline web apps,
    and drag and drop.

About HTML5 Web Applications, which have:

-   Improved search indexing with meta tags,

-   Better page load times, and

-   Enhanced user experience.

And about HTML5 Elements, which enable you to define and manage web page
structure and content.

<h3 id="ch2-4">2.4 HTML Scripting</h3>

Hello and welcome to HTML Scripting.

After reading this section, you will be able to describe how
scripting is enabled in browsers.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 19. enabling scripting (34) ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image019.png"
   alt="Enabling Scripting"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Scripting is enabled for a browser context, when the conditions shown on
the slide are true.

Scripting is used to provide a more interactive user experience when
browsing websites.

Since scripting can be turned off, the recommendation is to use
scripting but not to rely on it.

HTML5 also defines a text/html-sandboxed media type for documents.

This attribute can be used when hosting untrusted content.

The sandboxed browsing context can be set at the page level or specified
as an attribute on any tag that contains an embedded object.

If you are running a page with an embedded object without the sandbox
attribute, you are implicitly giving a third-party vendor permission to
run scripts with the same permissions that you have for the page.

Granting the embedded object the same permissions as the rest of your
page is one way that you can inadvertently allow advertisements to occur
in your application.

To prevent granting implicit permission to embedded objects, use the
sandbox attribute on any tag that contains an embedded object.

Each HTML document that is loaded into a browser page becomes a Document
object.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 20. html document api: dom tree accessors (35) ----------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image020.png"
   alt="HTML Document API - DOM Tree Accessors"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The Document object provides access to all HTML elements in a page and
can be accessed from within a script.

The DOM tree accessors are HTML document APIs that provide access to all
the HTML elements on a page.

The property to access is prefixed by the word document.

For example, <b>document.head</b> returns the first head element that is a
child of the html element, if there is one, otherwise null.

The function <b>document.images</b> returns an HTML Collection of the image
elements in the document.

The function <b>document.scripts</b> returns an HTML Collection of the
script elements in the document.

Here are some common HTML DOM tree methods:

   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

The <b>document.getElementById ('id')</b> function has one required
parameter which is the id of the element you want to access.

The id is specified as an attribute on one of the elements that is coded
elsewhere on the page.

The <b>document.getElementsByTagName('tag')</b> function has one required
parameter which is the tag name of the element you want to access.

This function returns a node list of all the elements with the tag that
matches the required parameter.

This is a fragment of HTML with JavaScript code that uses the document
API.

&nbsp;

When Submit is clicked inside the page that is running in a web browser,
the <i>textChecker</i> function begins.

The <b>document.getElementById('textField1')</b> retrieves the contents of
what was typed into the input field that has the id of textField1 and
places this content into a variable.

The JavaScript logic then tests whether any data was typed into the
field, and an alert dialog is displayed with the result.

A similar function will be used later in Exercise 1.

Here is the output from running the code on the previous page that uses
the document API.

is seen in an alert dialog box on the same page.

In this section, you learned:

-   Scripting is used to provide a more interactive user experience when
    browsing websites.

-   Since scripting can be turned off, the recommendation is to use
    scripting but not to rely on it,

-   Scripting is enabled when certain browser conditions are met,

-   HTML5 sandboxes enable you to manage iframe mash-ups; web pages that
    pull content from more than one site,

-   HTML documents loaded into a browser page become Document objects,
    which you can access through scripts.

<h3 id="ch2-5">2.5 HTML5 Browser Support</h3>

Hello and welcome to HTML5 Browser Support.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe browser support for HTML5 features.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 24. html5 browser support (39) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image024.png"
   alt="HTML5 Browser Support"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Not all browsers fully support all the features that are described in
the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications.

For example, older versions of browsers do not support certain features.

The developers of different browsers are continually adding support for
HTML5 features to their new browser versions.

For the most comprehensive support of HTML5 features, consider using
Google Chrome.

Support tables show which features are supported by which browsers and
can be a useful tool when developing web pages.

For example, caniuse.com has great support tables for HTML5, CSS3, and
more.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------- 25. how different browsers display html5 elements (39) --------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image025.png"
   alt="How Different Browsers Display HTML5 Elements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here are the results of displaying the \< input type= 'date' \>element
in different browsers.

The Google Chrome browser displays a calendar to enter the data.

The Microsoft Edge browser displays spinning boxes to enter the data.

Notice the difference in date formats (yyyy-mm-dd vs mm/dd/yyyy).

The Firefox browser displays the date field as a text field.

This could raise several issues regarding input format and validation.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 26. html5 browser support tables (40) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">

   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

This example shows a support table for the \< input type= 'date' \>
element.

The numbers represent the browser version. The color determines the
level of support.

-   Green: Full support

-   Olive: Partial support

-   Red: No support

Edge, Chrome, and Opera browsers are green, meaning they support the \<
input type= 'date' \> element.

Internet Explorer and Safari browsers are red, meaning they do not
support the type ='date'\> element.

Support levels change as developers of browsers add new features, so
check back frequently to see if the features you require are supported.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------ 27. verifying html5 browser support using javascript (41) ------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image027.png"
   alt="Verifying HTML5 Browser Support Using JavaScript"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can also use JavaScript to check whether a certain HTML5 element is
supported by a browser.

-   First, create a DOM element by typing document.createElement() and
    include the element type as a parameter argument. As a result, the
    DOM object gets created.

-   If the browser does not support that element, the DOM object that
    gets created has a set of common properties, but nothing specific
    for that element.

-   You then test for a known property or method on the DOM object that
    you created.

-   If that property or method does not exist, then the browser does not
    yet fully support the DOM element (or the HTML5 tag) that has been
    created.

Browsers that do not support the element can revert to a fallback or
default behavior such as displaying the field as a regular text field.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

</div>

Here is an example of using JavaScript to check whether a certain HTML5
element is supported by a browser.

This code is used to test whether the browser supports the element \<
input type= 'date' \>.

In the example, you dynamically create the DOM object for the input
element, and then you set the type attribute to the value of \"date".

If the browser does not support the input type =date, the field is
displayed in the browser as a regular text field.

Hello and welcome to CSS: Styling HTML.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain what a Cascade Style Sheet (CSS) is,

-   Describe how to use CSS to format HTML elements,

-   Describe how to use CSS in HTML documents to format web pages.

By using a combination of HTML5, JavaScript, and cascading style sheets,
developers can create web pages that can be displayed on desktop
computers and mobile devices.

These technologies have powerful features that can be used to show rich
interactive applications without requiring plug-in technologies, like
the Flash media player.

HTML documents might be rendered to a browser window, or through a
speech synthesizer to provide assistive technologies for vision impaired
people.

Being able to meet accessibility requirements is one advantage of using
HTML markup over browser plug-ins for delivering interactive content.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 31. what is css? (44) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image031.png"
   alt="What is CSS?"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

CSS is the design that is layered over the top of an HTML web page.

CSS is a style sheet language that describes how HTML elements are
displayed.

What makes the style sheet "cascading" is that developers can apply CSS
to create a uniform look throughout each element of each page of the
website.

Child and descendant elements often inherit styles that are defined for
parent elements, however, exceptions to this rule do exist.

For websites, it is an important concept to separate the data from the
design.

The data is sent to the browser by using HTML, and the design is applied
to that data by using a CSS.

This separation allows people to render a web page without your design
if they have special accessibility needs.

It allows machines (such as search engines) to index a website without
the design interfering.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 32. css design and coding (45) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image032.png"
   alt="CSS Design and Coding"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can code CSS as a style attribute in an HTML tag, a head section of
a document, or an external document.

The preference is to code CSS in external documents (referred to
as style sheets).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 33. what elements can css control? (45) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image033.png"
   alt="What Elements Can CSS Control?"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

You can use CSS to control a document's appearance and specify style
rules for the following web page elements: Fonts, Text, Colors,
Backgrounds, Sizes, Borders, Spacing, Positioning, Visual effects,
Tables, and Lists.

CSS style elements are structured like this.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------- 34. css format (46) -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image034.png"
   alt="CSS Format"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

In this example, the html-tag-name can be one of the following elements:

-   Any of the tags you find in HTML code (for example,\<a\>, \<div\>,
    \<li\>, or \<label\>, etc.)

-   An id reference that is displayed with a preceding hash symbol (#)
    in CSS code.

-   A class reference that is displayed with a preceding dot/period
    (.) symbol in CSS code.

When making a site design, begin by establishing the base style.
Establish a base style by styling the \<Body\> tag, as shown here.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 35. base styles (47) -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image035.png"
   alt="Base Styles"
   width="20%" />
&nbsp;

This example makes the following styles:

-   Sets the background color: off-white (background-color),

-   Ensures that the font color is black (color),

-   Ensures that all content edges match the edge of the browser window
    frame (margin and padding),

-   Horizontally aligns the textual content to the left (text-align),

-   Sets the font size to the browser's default (font-size) and uses a
    sans-serif (a font without the little flicks around the edges) as
    font family (font-family).

These settings are simple. Generally, follow these guidelines:

-   When a color is specified, use Red-Green-Blue (RGB) hexadecimal
    light values.

-   When a size is specified, use pixels (indicated by apx after the
    number); an em, which is indicated by em after the number (that is,
    the size of the font multiplied by the specified number); or
    a percentage, which is indicated by a % after the number.

-   Text can be aligned left,right, or center.

-   Floats can also be left or right.

-   Vertical alignments must be top, middle, or bottom.

-   Fonts can be any specific font or font family (serif, sans-serif, or
    monospace) or even a downloadable font.

One of the most important decisions you must make when you are
determining the design of your website is whether to use a fluid or
a fixed layout.

A fluid layout is a layout in which the height and width of elements is
flexible and can expand or contract based on the browser window, the
operating system, and other user preferences.

You specify these elements mostly by using percentages and ems.

A fixed layout is a layout where you specify the height and width of
elements, and those values remain the same regardless of which operating
system or browser you use to access the website.

You specify these elements mostly by using pixels.

When determining the layout, consider also the pros and cons for fluid
and fixed layouts.

The type of layout you choose depends on the type and amount of content
and the target audience of the website.

To apply a CSS, you must tell the browser where to look for it.

This step is the only true point where HTML references a CSS.

You can make the reference in one of two ways---the or the tag Style tag
It "dirties" the page with a non-HTML code.

You apply this style to only one page.

If you copy and paste this style on each page, this approach increases
the load time of each page, which causes the user to wait longer.

<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

<h3>Link tag</h3>

You can link to it from other pages, which ensures a clean HTML and a
smaller page size.

To use this method, the tag must be added to the  tag section.

In this section , you learned:

-   CSS creates a uniform look throughout each element of each page of
    the website,

-   CSS design is separate from the data,

-   Design can be removed for special accessibility renders,

-   Search engines can index the website without the design interfering,

-   CSS is usually coded in external style sheets,

-   Create base styles for your website first,

-   Choose a layout type,

-   Fluid: the height and width of elements is flexible and can expand
    or contract,

-   Fixed: the height and width of elements remains the same.

<h2 id="ch3">Chapter 3: HTML5 Elements</h2>

HTML5 has many elements that enable developers to create well-structured
and varied websites. These HTML5 elements provide ways to separate an
HTML document into divisions, create headers and footers, define
sections, create headings, and delineate the body of the document. In
addition, there are many HTML5 elements that allow the user to interact
with the website, inputting information in various formats like dates,
times, numbers, email addresses, and much more besides.  To be able to
create the structure you want for your site, you must be familiar with
some of these elements.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

-   Describe the basic structural elements of HTML5.

-   Describe the attributes of HTML5 input elements.

<h3 id="ch3-1">3.1 HTML5 Tags and Structural Elements</h3>

Hello. Welcome to HTML5 Tags and Structural Elements.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   List specific elements to HTML5 and

-   Describe HTML5 structural elements:

    -   section, article, header, footer, figure, fig caption.

<div align="right">

&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

There are many HTML5 specific elements. The table shows some of them.

Notice that the HTML5 element tags have intuitive names, such as audio
that is used to embed sound content, and canvas that is used for
graphical content.

Not all of these element tags are covered in this section, so take a
moment to read through the table.

This table shows more HTML5 elements.

The last tag in the table is the comments tag.

Comments in HTML can assist the developer to explain what the code does.

The browsers do not display these comments, unless the viewer views the
source.

&nbsp;

In a division-based layout, each part of a page that you want to format
differently is separated into its own division.

Think of the natural divisions into which you can divide the page that
is shown here.

These divisions might include the page title, a banner with selectable
tabs, an area for the image, and further blocks for text and thumbnail
images.

The \<div\> tag was not introduced in HTML5, but is a good starting
point for laying out a page or document.

Then, you can use other HTML5-specific structural elements inside the
tag.

Most HTML elements have a semantic meaning. In other words, the element
describes either the function or the type of data that is contained
within.

For example, a \<p\> element is a paragraph that usually contains some
text.

In contrast, the \<div\> tag has no innate semantic meaning besides the
logical grouping of the content.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image041.png"
   alt="HTML5 Structural Elements #2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can use these dedicated elements to mark up your website, rather
than using the generic \<div\> or \<span\> elements.

An \<article\> defines a block of code that can be distinguished from
the rest of the page.

A \<section\> defines a logical separation in the document such as the
numbered chapters of an online manual.

A \<header\> element is used to group the headers for a page.

The \<footer\> defines the area at the bottom of the page.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 42. example with structural elements (56) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">

&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

This code example shows some of the HTML5 structural elements.

Here, the \<article\> element is used to create an online news report.

The \<article\> includes a header.

Within the \<article\>, the page is marked up into sections that have
their own headers.

The page also includes a \<footer\> element.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image043.png"
   alt="Elements for Grouping Content"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The \<aside\> tag is used to provide additional information that is
related to the main discussion.

The \<aside\> tag lets you extract and display further content or go to
additional resources without detracting from the main discussion.

The \<figure\> tag defines a self-contained element that is referred to
from the main content.

The \<figure\> element can be used to embed graphics, images, or code
sections.

The \<figurecaption\> tag defines the caption for the contents of the
element.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 44. navigational elements (58) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">

&nbsp;

Websites typically have sections that are dedicated to navigational
links that go to these sites or for moving between pages of a single
application.

In HTML5 syntax, these navigational links are placed inside a \<nav\>
tag.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 45. navigational elements #2 (58) -------------------------------->

In this section, you learned:

-   Tags provide control within an HTML5 document.

-   Some tags provide structural elements:

-   The \<div\> tag separates areas in a document into divisions,
    enabling you to apply different styles to different parts of a
    document.

-   Dedicated elements like \<article\>, \<section\>, \<header\>, and
    \<footer\> are more specific than the generic element.

-   The \<aside\>, \<figure\> and \<figurecaption\> tags enable you to
    group content.

-   And the \<nav\> tags enable you to group navigational links.

<h3 id="ch3-2">3.2 HTML5 Input Element: Attributes for the Input Tag</h3>

Hello. Welcome to HTML5 Input Element: Attributes for the Input Tag.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe the attributes of the HTML5 input element input type
    attributes tel, email, date time, number, range, and color.

The \< input type= \"color\" / \> attribute allows the user to select a
color.

The dialog varies depending on the browser.

Some browsers don't support this input type.

In non-supporting browsers, this input type is displayed as a regular
text input field into which the user might type a valid color name or
color code.

The \< input type=\"date\" \> attribute is a date control (year, month,
day) with no time zone.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- 47. input for date (60) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image047.png"
   alt="Input for Date"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

The example shows the input type=\"date\" field as it is seen in Google
Chrome.

The input dialog varies from browser to browser.

The datetime-local attribute provides input for a date and time (year,
month, day, hour, minute, AM/PM) with no time zone.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 48. input for date and time (60) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image048.png"
   alt="Input for Date & Time"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The datetime-local input field is displayed as a drop-down calendar in
the Google Chrome browser. The time can be typed or entered using the
spinner control.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 49. input for emails (60) ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image049.png"
   alt="Input for Emails"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The \< input type=\"email\" \> attribute is displayed as a regular text
input field.

It provides feedback when the input does not follow the email format.

The \< input type=\"number\" \> takes a numeric value as input.

You can optionally specify the minimum, maximum values, step size, etc.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 50. input for type number (60) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image050.png"
   alt="Input for Type Number"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The example shows the number selector in the Chrome browser. Only the
numbers between 5 and the 10 are available for selection.

The \< input type=\"range\" \> takes a numeric range as input.

The example shows the number selector in the Google Chrome browser.

Only the numbers in the range of the minimum and the maximum are
available for selection.

The range attribute displays a slider with the range of values between
the minimum and maximum.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 51. input of type range (61) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image051.png"
   alt="Input of Type Range"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

Only the slider itself is shown. Additional JavaScript code is needed in
order to display the value of the slider.

The differences between \< input type=\"search\"\\ \> and \< input
type=\"text\" / \> are mostly in style.

WebKit-based browsers return a history of recently searched text
strings.

The search input field on the Safari browser has rounded corners.

The input type=\"tel\" pattern=\"\[parameters\]\" attribute expects a
telephone number as input.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 52. input of phone number (61) ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image052.png"
   alt="Input of Phone Number"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

On its own, the \< input type=\"tel\" \> provides nothing more than a
text entry field in the browsers.

It does not enforce numeric only input since many telephone numbers
include other characters, such as the plus sign and hyphens.

You need to supply your own pattern matcher if you want the browser to
validate the telephone number.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- 53. input for urls (62) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image053.png"
   alt="Input for URL's"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The URL attribute is used to validate that the user typed in a properly formatted URL or web address.

The \< input list=\"some_list\" \> provides a list of auto-complete suggestions for the input field.

Not to be confused with the \< select \> element. Useful for auto-complete functionality.

You can fill the list by nesting

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------- 54. input attribute 'list' used with <datalist> (62) ---------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image054.png"
   alt="Input Attribute 'list' used with <datalist>"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;
<div align="right">
  <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

These options are the types of fruits listed in the drop-down list.

Placeholder text is used to provide hints of what the input text format
looks like.

The placeholder fills the input text field with the example values in a
lighter shade of text.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------- 55. input attribute 'placeholder' used as example (63) --------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image055.png"
   alt="Input Attribute 'placeholder' used to provide an example of the input format"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The form does not submit the placeholder text value if the input text is
not overwritten.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------ 56. input attribute 'required' indicates that field is required (63) -------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image056.png"
   alt="Input Attribute 'required' indicates that the field is required"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The required attribute implies that some text must be typed.

The requirement to type some input applies even if the field contains
placeholder text.

What happens if browser-based validation is not supported for these
input attributes?

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 57. validation fallback (64) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image057.png"
   alt="Validation Fallback"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

There are several options to performing validation in browsers that do
not support all HTML5 input attributes.

You can use JavaScript and JQuery libraries.

You can assume that more browsers will support these features over time,
and leave all final validation to server-side processing.

You can code client-side validation that is attached to the form submit
event handler to validate all the fields on the form when the form is
submitted.

In this section, you learned:

-   Common attributes of the \< input \> tag.

-   How to implement validation fallback.

<h3 id="ch3-3">3.3 Chapter 3 Summary</h3>

In this module, you learned that:

-   To structure a document, HTML5 uses elements like:

    -   \<div\>
    -   \<header\>
    -   \<footer\>
    -   \<section\>
    -   \<body\>
    -   \<heading\>

-   HTML5 uses the \<input\> tag to allow users to input information. It
    has many different types, including:

    -   Color

<h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4: JavaScript Programming for Web Applications</h2>

Now you have a website or Cloud App with structure and content from
HTML, consistent style from CSS, and a limited amount of interactivity
for the user.  To enhance the user experience and create a real wow
factor, you're going to need JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can make
your webpages dynamic, using features like interactive forms, picture
slideshows, and sophisticated menu systems.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

-   Describe the basic syntax of JavaScript.

-   Explain how to work with variables in JavaScript.

-   Describe how to control the flow of a JavaScript application with
    control statements.

-   Outline the use of functions and prototypes in JavaScript.

-   Explain the use of client-side JavaScript with HTML.

-   Describe how JavaScript integrates with the document object model
    (DOM).

-   List the common APIs used in JavaScript Applications.

<h3>JavaScript Language Overview & Syntax</h3>

Hello. Welcome to The JavaScript language, Overview and Syntax.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe JavaScript primitives and objects.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 58. the nature of javascript (66) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image058.png"
   alt="The Nature of JavaScript"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

JavaScript is a scripting language that is derived from the ECMAScript
standard and originally designed to run on the Netscape Navigator
browser:

Virtually all browsers now support JavaScript.

Although the name "Java" appears in the word "JavaScript", the two
languages are not related.

When a JavaScript interpreter is embedded in a browser, the result is
the ability to create dynamic web pages:

JavaScript adds behavior to otherwise static web content.

The content of a web page can be dynamically changed with the scripting
capability of the JavaScript interpreter.

JavaScript code acts on the document object model that the web browser
generates.

One of the ways that server programming and browser scripting work
together is in an architecture that is called Ajax, or Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML.

The term \"Ajax\" encompasses more than asynchronous server calls
through JavaScript and XML.

Ajax represents a series of techniques that provide richer, interactive
web applications through HTML, JavaScript, Cascading style sheets, and
modifying the web page through the Document Object Model.

Nowadays, JSON is commonly used instead of XML.

In JavaScript, there are five primitive types that are associated with
various primitive values:

1.  Number: All numbers, such as 0 or 3.1412,

2.  String: All strings, such as "Hello World",

3.  Boolean: The values true or false,

4.  Null: The value null,

5.  Undefined: The value undefined, since a data type has not been
    assigned or the variable does not exist.

All other non-primitive data types are objects.

The number primitive represents both integer and floating point values,
the value NaN (not a number), and Infinity.

Integers can be coded as base 10 (decimal), base 8 (octal), or base 16
(hexadecimal) values.

The integer literal 16 in decimal, 020 in octal, and 0x10 in hexadecimal
all have the same value.

All numbers in JavaScript are represented internally as double precision
(64 bit) floating point numbers.

JavaScript strings are delimited by either double or single quotation
marks.

There is no behavior or methods that are associated with primitive data
types.

The primitive types number, string, and boolean can be wrapped by their
object counterparts.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 59. wrapper objects (69) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image059.png"
   alt="Wrapper Objects: Start with an Uppercase"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Wrapper objects have the same name as the primitive type, except they
start with an uppercase letter.

Like most object-oriented programming languages, JavaScript provides
built-in ways to convert between these wrapper objects and primitive
values.

The wrapper objects use special methods such as the <i>valueOf</i> and
<i>toString</i> methods to convert between objects and primitive literals.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 60. examples with wrapper objects (69) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image060.png"
   alt="Examples with Wrapper Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The <i>typeof</i> keyword in JavaScript is used to find out the data type of
the supplied operand.

Notice how strings created without the new keyword have a type of
string.

The keyword new is used to create the String wrapper object.

This object can be converted to a primitive string type by calling the
valueOf function on the object wrapper class.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- 61. array objects defined (70) ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image061.png"
   alt="Arrays are specialized collection objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Arrays are specialized collection objects that aid the programmer in the
storage and retrieval of data by indexed keys.

Arrays use a zero-based indexing scheme, meaning that the first element
of an array has an index of zero.

Arrays grow or shrink dynamically by adding or removing elements.

The length property holds the number of elements that occur in the
array.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 62. declaring array objects (70) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image062.png"
   alt="Declaring Array Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Arrays can be declared by using either an array constructor or an array
literal.

When declaring an array with a constructor, you use the new array
keywords and specify the array elements as parameters of the new array.

Array literals are created by declaring the array elements within square
brackets.

You then assign the array to a variable, as seen in the last example on
the slide.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 63. date objects (71) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image063.png"
   alt="Date Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The Date object is a specialized object that is used to hold the date
and time.

The constructor for a date object is in the format: new Date (\[with
optional parameters\]).

If you create a Date object without any parameters, JavaScript returns
an object that contains the current local date and time.

If you send this date object to the console or try to display the date
object on a web page, JavaScript automatically applies a toString method
to the object.

The result that is displayed is a string version of the date as shown on
this slide.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 64. date objects (72) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image064.png"
   alt="Date Objects #2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can also create new dates by passing parameters to the new Date
function.

Examples on the slide show how either string or numeric values can be
used for the date parameters when creating new date objects.

As with other object-oriented languages, JavaScript creates error object
instances when an exception occurs.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 65. error objects (72) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image065.png"
   alt="Error Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The error object instance includes two properties that contain
information about the error:

-   The message property contains a description about the error.

-   The name property identifies the type of error such as a RangeError.

A RangeError is an error instance that is created when a numeric value
or parameter is outside of its valid range.

Besides a generic error, there are six other core errors types in
JavaScript, three of which are shown on the slide.

The other three are EvalError, ReferenceError, and SyntaxError.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- 66. custom error types (73) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image066.png"
   alt="Custom Error Types"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The Error object can be extended to create custom error types.

The last line of the slide shows the creation of a generic error object
with a custom error message in the parameter field.

In this section, you learned:

-   JavaScript is a scripting language that adds behavior to otherwise
    static web content.

-   Primitives are values, and have no properties or methods. 
	Examples of primitives include:

```{=html}
	-   number, string, boolean, null, and undefined.
```

-   Wrapper objects allow objects of corresponding primitive data types
    to be created.

-   Wrapper objects can store a primitive value and provide methods with
    which to process it.

-   Wrapper objects have the same name as the primitive type, but they
    begin with a capital letter to differentiate them from the primitive
    data type itself.
	Examples of wrapper objects are:

```[=html]
	-   array, data, and error objects.
```

<h3 id="ch4-1">4.1 JavaScript: Variables & Control Statements</h3>

<h3><b>Hello. Welcome to JavaScript Variables and Control</b> Statements.</h3>

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how variables are declared and used in JavaScript,

-   Describe JavaScript control structures,

Variables are declared with the var keyword followed by the variable
name, as in the example, var age,

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 67. a primer on variables (74) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image067.png"
   alt="A Primer on Variables"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Variables can be declared and initialized in one step, as in the
example, var age = 54,

You can assign a value to the variable at a later time, or reassign the
value of a variable,

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 68.  a primer on variables #2 (75) ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image068.png"
   alt="A Primer on Variables #2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Since JavaScript is a loosely typed language, you do not need to declare
the data type of a variable. The variable assumes the data type from the
value of the field during assignment and the type of a variable can
change during program execution.

Beware of not initializing variables though -- the value of 'var age' --
that has not been assigned a value, is not zero, or an empty String, or
any other useful default value; it is 'undefined'.

Remember that the only keyword is 'var', and JavaScript has no way to
know whether this variable is a numeric or a string, or anything else,
until you provide a value.

It therefore cannot decide by default whether to assign a zero or an
empty string.

Variable names, or identifiers, have these rules:

-   The name must start with a letter, underscore (\_), or a dollar sign
    (\$),

-   Subsequent characters can also be digits \[0-9\] Identifiers are
    case-sensitive.

-   Variables also have a scope:

-   Variables declared within a function have a scope local to that
    function,

-   Variables declared outside of a function have a global scope.

-   Variables with a global scope can be used elsewhere in the
    JavaScript program,

-   Variables declared without the var keyword have a global scope.

-   Variables that are not initialized have a value of undefined.

You learn about functions shortly.

Conditional statements are the set of commands that are used to perform
different actions for different conditions:

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 69. compound control statements (76) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image069.png"
   alt="Compound Control Statements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

In JavaScript, the IF statement is the way the program logic decides
which path to take based on the current values of variables or object
properties,

The JavaScript syntax for a decision begins with the keyword IF,
followed by the condition to test; then the statements that run if the
condition yields a true result.

The true processing follows immediately after the test condition and is
delimited by braces, unless it is a single statement.

If the condition resolves to false, the statements that follow the else
keyword are executed.

Indentation of the statements of a compound control statement is not
required in JavaScript

However, a programmer can find that indentation helps in deciphering the
control statement.

Many JavaScript aware text editors automatically indent the control
structure to make it more readable.

Unlike Java, there is no block statement scope in JavaScript.

Having no block statement scope means that variables declared inside one
IF condition can be used outside the scope of that condition.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- 70. swtich statement (77) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image070.png"
   alt="Switch Statement"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

JavaScript supports the switch statement as an alternative to the IF
then ELSE control statements.

The condition that is being tested is placed in parentheses that follow
the switch keyword.

The expression parameter of the switch statement can evaluate to any
number or string value.

The labels in the case statement are enclosed in quotation marks when
the labels represent string values of the expression.

The program looks for a case clause with a label that matches the value
of expression and then transfers control to that clause, running the
associated statements.

If no matching label is found, the program looks for the optional
default clause, and if found, transfers control to that clause, issuing
the associated statements.

The break keyword is used to prevent the code from automatically falling
into the next case clause.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 71. repeat with for loop (78) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image071.png"
   alt="Repeat with for loop"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The FOR loop repeats a series of statements for any number of times.

The FOR loop takes three parameter arguments, namely the initial value,
the condition that is being tested, and the increment expression.

When the FOR loop runs, the following occurs:

-   First, the initial expression is set,

-   Second, the conditional expression is evaluated.

If this condition evaluates to true, the loop statements runs and the
increment expression is updated.

If the condition evaluates to false, the FOR loop terminates.

If the loop does not terminate, control returns to the second step and
the conditional expression is evaluated again.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 72. repeat with while loops (78) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image072.png"
   alt="Repeat with while loops"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The WHILE loop is another common loop in JavaScript,

The loop repeats while the condition remains true,

The WHILE loop assumes that the condition reaches a conclusion and then
exits the loop.

Make sure that the condition evaluates to false at some point; otherwise
the loop never terminates.

In this section, you learned:

-   Variables are declared using the keyword var followed by the
    variable name.

-   You can initialize variables at the time of declaration or assign a
    value later.

-   You do not need to declare the data type of a variable. Variables
    take their data type from the value assigned and can change type
    during program execution.

-   Variables also have a scope.

-   Variables declared within a function have a scope local to that
    function.

-   Variables declared outside of a function have a global scope.

-   Variables declared without the var keyword have a global scope.

When executing, the flow of the program is directed by control
statements, including:

-   Conditional statements like if\...then\...else,

-   Switch statements,

-   Repeat statements like for loops and while loops.

<h3 id="ch4-2">4.2 JavaScript: Functions & Prototypes</h3>

Hello. Welcome to JavaScript Functions and Prototypes.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe functions in JavaScript, and

-   Describe prototypes in JavaScript.

A function is a block of code which can be called from any point in a
script after being declared.

A function is made up of the following parts:

-   The keyword function,

-   The name of the function,

-   Parentheses, with optional parameter arguments,

-   Curly braces, with the logic,

The last statement in a function block is the optional return statement
that returns control back to whatever called the function.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 73. Functions: Parts of a Function (80) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image073.png"
   alt="Functions: Parts of a Function"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

This example is a function that is named add.

This function takes two parameter arguments and returns the sum of the
arguments or concatenates the two arguments if they are strings.

Notice that you do not specify the data type for the arguments of the
function.

The data types are determined by the values of the arguments that are
being passed to the function.

There is no specific return type declared -- the function returns
whatever type is required.

In this case, the return is a simple addition or concatenation of the
input parameters.

The action chosen depends on what data is provided to the function.

If the values can be interpreted as numbers, they are added.

If they can be interpreted as strings, they are concatenated.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 74. Creating Custom Objects (81) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image074.png"
   alt="Creating Custom Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

This is an example of declaring a function named Car that accepts three
arguments as parameters.

A little further down, you specifically ask the function to run, by
declaring the statement:

var c = new Car with the arguments; "meridian", "Sabre GT" and 2012.

In the Car function, the keyword \"this\" refers to the current instance
of the Car object that is being created. In other words, an instance of
Car that is associated with the variable named c.

The getName function of Car returns the make, model, and year of the
newly created Car object.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 75. Creating custom Objects (81) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image075.png"
   alt="Creating Custom Objects"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

By using prototypes, you can easily define properties and methods for
all instances of a particular object.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 76. Prototypes (82) --------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image076.png"
   alt="Prototypes"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Prototypes exist for all JavaScript objects that can be created with the
new keyword.

All object constructors create objects that inherit the properties and
methods that are defined by the prototype for that object.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------ 77. Prototypes (82) --------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image077.png"
   alt="Prototypes"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Any object that gets instantiated inherits the current state of the
prototype.

Scripts can override prototype properties and functions.

If they do so, these changes affect the current working instances of
objects that match the prototype.

In the Car example that is shown on the slide, you can add another
property to the Car prototype, with the statement:

Car.prototype.property_name as in:

Car.prototype.floor_model = true;

Any Car object that you create, or any car object that is already
created, automatically inherits the new floor_model property and its
value.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 78. adding functions to prototypes (82) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image078.png"
   alt="Adding Functions to Prototypes"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here is another example that uses a prototype to change Car instances.

This time, you add a method function called getName to the Car
prototype.

Now when a Car object is instantiated, it also includes the getName
function that returns the make, model, and year.

All existing instances of the Car object also inherit the getName
method.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------ 79. self-executing function (82) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image079.png"
   alt="Self-Executing Functions Run Immediately After Being Declared"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Functions are usually declared first, and not run until you specifically
ask them to, as you saw in some of the previous examples.

Auto-invocation or self-executing functions start running immediately
after being declared.

The functions and variables inside self-executing functions are only
available to the code inside the self-executing function.

Auto-invocation functions can also be unnamed or anonymous functions,
and have the format that is shown in the code block on the slide.

Self-executing functions are often used to initialize data or to declare
DOM elements on the page.

In this section, you learned:

-   A function is a block of code which can be called from any point in
    a script after being declared.

-   Functions can take arguments passed as parameters and can return
    results.

-   By using prototypes, you can easily define properties and methods
    for all instances of a specific object.

Prototypes exist for all JavaScript objects that can be created with the
new keyword.

To add a new function to the template for the object, modify the
prototype for the object.

Self-executing (auto-invocation) functions start running immediately
after they have been declared.

The functions and variables are isolated from the rest of the script.

<h3>Module 4, JavaScript: Functions & Prototypes</h3>

Prototypes exist for all JavaScript objects that can be created with the

All object constructors create objects that inherit the properties and
methods that are defined by the prototype for that object.

Any object that gets instantiated inherits the current state of the
prototype.

Scripts can override prototype properties and functions.

If they do so, these changes affect the current working instances of
objects that match the prototype.

In the Car example that is shown on the slide, you can add another
property to the Car prototype, with the statement:

Car.prototype.property_name as in:

Car.prototype.floor_model = true;

Any Car object that you create, or any car object that is already
created, automatically inherits the new floor_model property and its
value.

<h3 id="ch4-3">4.3 Client-Side JavaScript: with HTML</h3>

Hello. Welcome to Client-side JavaScript.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Define a client-side script,

-   Give examples of when client-side script can be used,

-   Explain how to use the

-   Describe Event Binding in scripts.

A client-side script is a program that accompanies an HTML document or
might be embedded directly in the HTML document itself.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 85. scripts in html (88) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image085.png"
   alt="Scripts in HTML"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The script program runs on the client device when the document loads, or
at some other time such as when a link is activated or when a button is

Although JavaScript is widely used as a scripting language in HTML,
other scripting languages can be used instead.

Scripts offer authors a means to modify and extend HTML documents in
highly interactive ways.

Scripts can run after an HTML document is loaded.

Scripts can be used to validate forms or to process input as it is
typed.

Scripts can be triggered by events that occur on a web page, such as the
clicking of a button.

Scripts can be used to dynamically create document elements on an HTML
page.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image086.png"
   alt="<SCRIPT> tag example"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

This slide shows two ways in which the document.

Example 1 demonstrates how you can include a script directly inside the
HTML document.

This method is good for short scripts, but when a script is long, the
method used in example 2 is preferred.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 87. <script> tag examples: example 2 (89) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image087.png"
   alt="<SCRIPT> tag example 2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Example 2 uses the src attribute to point to an external script file.

This method has several use cases, such as importing JavaScript
libraries for complex interactions or using the same script across
several HTML documents.

Some users who visit your website might disable JavaScript from running,
or they might be using a browser that does not support scripting.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image088.png"
   alt="When Scripting is NOT Available <noscript>"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

To allow for these situations, place the content for the alternative
path within the tag.

If the browser does not support scripting, the browser runs the section
of code that is within the noscript tag.

Scripts can be run on the detection of certain events that happen when
the page is running in a browser session.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image089.png"
   alt="Scripts Tied to Intrinsic Events"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

For example, the onload event can run a script when the browser finishes
loading a page.

Or a function can be performed when the onclick event occurs.

This event occurs when the pointing device is clicked over an element,
such as a button, that declares a handler for the event.

The event handler is a function that declares what to do when the button
is clicked.

&nbsp;

Here the inline event handler named showAnswers runs when the button is
clicked.

In this section, you learned:

-   A client-side script is a program that accompanies an HTML document.

It may even be embedded into the HTML itself.

-   Scripts offer developers ways to extend HTML documents to enhance
    the user experience, especially by incorporating more interactive
    elements.

-   You can use the script tag to include a script within the HTML
    document, or to call a script from an external file.

-   Use the noscript tag to provide an alternative when scripting is
    disabled.

-   Scripts can be bound to events so that they run automatically.

For example, the onload event can run a script when the browser finishes
loading a page.

<h3 id="ch4-4">4.4 Client-Side JavaScript: with DOM</h3>

Hello. Welcome to Client-side JavaScript.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Describe the document object model (DOM) hierarchy.

-   Describe the window and document objects.

-   Identify the DOM objects that are commonly used in JavaScript
    applications for working with HTML documents.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 91. dom programming interface (93) ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image091.png"
   alt="DOM Programming Interface"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The document object model is the programming interface between HTML or
XHTML and JavaScript.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a browser-based interface for
applications and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
structure, and style of documents.

JavaScript uses the DOM to access and modify web page elements in the
web browser.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------- 92. dom levels (93) -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image092.png"
   alt="DOM Levels"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The World Wide Web Consortium released four levels of the Document
Object Model specifications.

Each successive level provides a more detailed set of features for
describing structured documents.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 93. basic dom model for browsers (94) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image093.png"
   alt="Basic DOM Model for Browsers"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The different browsers have various levels of compatibility with the DOM
standard.

The discussion of the DOM in this unit focuses on the DOM Level 1 Core
and DOM Level 1 HTML

APIs to access HTML elements with the DOM.

The JavaScript engine in most web browsers fully supports DOM level 1.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 93. basic dom model for browsers (94) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image093.png"
   alt="Basic DOM Model for Browsers"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here is a representation of the basic DOM model for browsers:

The window object is at the top of the DOM hierarchy and controls the
environment that contains the document.

The history object keeps internal details about the recent history of
pages in the browser.

The history object has methods for letting you simulate clicking the
back or forward buttons in a browser.

The location object contains information about the URL of a page.

The navigator is an object representation of the client Internet browser
(user agent).

There is no standard that applies to the navigator object, so the
property values returned when running queries on the navigator object
are not consistent across browsers.

The screen object is used to derive information about a user\'s screen,
such as the dimensions of the display screen.

The screen object is useful for determining the screen size of browser
windows that run on mobile devices.

The document object provides access to all HTML elements within a page.

Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document
object.

The window object is the outermost global container of all the objects
in the DOM hierarchy.

When the browser loads a page, a window object is automatically created
for you.

You can then access the window object properties and functions from your
JavaScript code.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 94. client-side window object (95) ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image094.png"
   alt="Client-Side Window Object"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

In client-side JavaScript, the Window object serves as the global object
and everything in the DOM takes place in a window.

A number of predefined methods exist for the window object.

The window.alert, window.confirm, and window.prompt dialogs that are
used in web pages, come from the global window object.

You can leave out the window prefix for methods in the DOM API. So the
window.alert method can be coded more simply as alert with a message
argument.

This figure shows the object model for a simple HTML document.

Notice how the object hierarchy matches the HTML containment hierarchy
on the left.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 95. html document object diagram (96) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image095.png"
   alt="HTML Document Object Diagram"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The object diagram can also be represented as a tree structure that
corresponds to the structure of the HTML document.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------- 96. html document object diagram with tree (96) ------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image096.png"
   alt="HTM Document Object Diagram with Tree"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The branches of the tree structure are termed nodes.

There are two types of nodes in the W3C DOM, element nodes and text
nodes.

All HTML tags (html, head, meta, title, and body) are element nodes.

The nodes that contain actual text that go between an element start tag
and end tag, are text nodes.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 97. DOM Level 2 Tree for a Form (97) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image097.png"
   alt="DOM Level 2 Tree for a Form"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The figure shows the DOM level 2 tree for the FORM portion of the
document.

The line feeds between elements are text nodes and are part of the DOM
level 2 tree.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 98. DOM Level 2 Tree for a Form #2 (97) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image098.png"
   alt=""
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The DOM level 2 tree includes a line feed text node before the paragraph
and input elements.

The input element includes a text node that contains all the text that
follows the input tag.

An additional line feed text node follows the input element.

The DOM level 0 for the form portion of the document would have only the
form, p, and input boxes.

The DOM level 2 adds the carriage returns, tabs, and spaces, sometimes
referred to as \"white space\".

In this section, you learned:

-   The document object model (DOM) is the programming interface between
    HTML or XHTML and JavaScript.

-   Each successive level of the DOM provides a more detailed set of
    features for describing structured documents.

-   Different browsers have different levels of compatibility with the
    DOM standard.

-   The basic DOM for browsers is a hierarchy that includes objects that
    perform different functions.

For example, the window object controls the environment of the document,
the location object contains information about the URL of the page,
screen object derives information about the user's screen, and the
document object provides access to all HTML elements within a page.

-   DOM levels define object types, with which developers can build a
    variety of documents, from plain HTML documents for web pages, to
    more complex forms.

<h3 id="ch4-5">4.5 JavaScript DOM Objects</h3>

Hello. Welcome to JavaScript Dom Objects

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Identify the DOM objects that are commonly used in JavaScript
    applications for working with HTML documents.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 99. dom html-related note types (98) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image099.png"
   alt="DOM HTML-Related Node Types"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The W3C DOM level 2 defines 12 different types of nodes, seven of which
have direct applicability in HTML documents.

Node types that are not applicable to HTML are omitted from the table.

This table is of interest so that when you view a DOM tree, you
understand the meaning of the numeric node types.

Each node type is a named constant that is also represented by an
integer value.

For example:

An ELEMENT_NODE type is represented by the integer 1.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------- 100. dom html-related node types (99) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image100.png?raw=true" 
     alt="DOM - HTML-related Node Types" 
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

An ATTRIBUTE_NODE type is represented by the integer 2.

A TEXT_NODE type is represented by the integer 3.

A COMMENT_NODE is represented by the integer 8.

In the DOM tree, the node name for ELEMENT_NODE type is the name of the
element or tag.

For example, if you are looking at a DIV element, the node name is DIV.

If the DIV element has an attribute like id=div123, then the attribute
name is "id" and the attribute value is "div123", which is the
name-value pair.

Another example:

If a paragraph element is followed by some text, the text string has a
node name of hash-sign-text, and the node value is the text string
itself.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 101. dom level 2 properties (100) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image101.png?raw=true" 
     alt="DOM Level 2 Properties"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The table lists some of the DOM Level 2 node object properties and
corresponding data types.

You see these properties when you view a DOM tree for an HTML page in a
browser's developer tools, like Chrome's DevTools.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 102. accessing document elements #1 (100) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image102.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Accessing Document Elements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

How do you access the elements on an HTML page with the DOM API?

When the document is loaded, the browser creates arrays for forms,
images, anchors, links, applets, and embeds.

It then places all the objects of each type into these arrays.

The arrays are indexed as they occur in the source document. The first
index of each array starts at zero.

Each of the array types, such as forms\[\], contains an array of
elements\[\] with each index element being the fields or buttons that
occur in that form.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 103. accessing document elements #2 (101) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image103.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Accessing Document Elements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can reference the element named field1 in the figure by its relative
position as document.forms\[0\].elements\[0\].

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 104. accessing document elements #3 (101) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image104.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Accessing Document Elements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

You can reference the same field with named elements; for example,
document.forms\[\"form1\"\].elements\[\"field1\"\], or even the
shortened document.form1.field1.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 105. accessing document elements #4 (102) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image105.png?raw=true"
   alt="Accessing Document Elements"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Since only one document can be contained in a window, shown by the
dashed line in the figure, you can leave out the window prefix. However,
you cannot omit the document prefix from the referenced object.

The id attribute identifies an element in a document.

The id attribute of an element is used by scripts to refer to the
element with a name that matches the value of the id attribute.

In order to assign a scriptable reference name to an HTML element with
the id attribute, use the following conventions:

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 106. object naming (102) ------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image106.png?raw=true"
     alt="Object Nameing"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The id must be a unique name in the document.

The name must be in quotation marks when assigned to the id attribute.

The name must not start with a numeric digit.

The function that is used to return a node object that matches the id
value is document.getElementById with the name of the id as a parameter
argument.

It is suggested that the same value is used for both the id and the name
attribute (seen earlier) when both are used.

In this section, you learned:

-   How to work with DOM objects in JavaScript, including:

-   You can access nested objects using a dot notation.

-   Objects can be named to make accessing them from the script easier.

<h3 id="ch4-6">4.6 JavaScript APIs</h3>

Hello. Welcome to JavaScript APIs.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how to work with nodes,

-   Describe how to modify the content of an element,

-   Explain how to modify the inline style of an object,

-   Describe how to modify the attributes of an object,

-   Describe how to use Window object methods and events.

The DOM Level 1 core and Level 1 HTML specifications have too much
detail for one unit.

Instead, the remainder of the unit focuses on script functions and
properties that are commonly used when working with HTML pages.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------------- 107. common apis (103) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image107.png?raw=true" 
     alt="Common APIs"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Some of these common APIs used in when accessing HTML DOM elements in
web pages are seen on the slide.

DOM elements are reviewed next.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 108. retrieving a reference to a node (104) -------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image108.png?raw=true"
     alt="Retrieving a Reference to a Node"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

To retrieve a node reference for an element of a document given an id,
use the document.getElementById function and pass the id value as an
argument.

This returns one specific HTML or XML element if a matching unique id is
found on the web page.

The getElementsByTagName function retrieves a NodeList of elements with
a specified tag name.

The NodeList contains an array of elements in your document.

You provide the name of the element you are interested in and an array
of all elements with that name found in the document is returned.

For HTML elements, the tagName parameter is the literal name of the HTML
tag.

If you run the function getElementsByTagName with a "p" as a parameter
argument, a NodeList of all the paragraphs in the document is returned.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 109. example: retrieving all images (104) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image109.png?raw=true" 
     alt="Example: Retrieving All Images"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

This example shows how you can retrieve all the image elements from a
web page by using the getElementsByTagName function and passing "img" as
the parameter argument.

The result is a NodeList that is assigned to the variable imgSet.

In the next part of the code, you loop through the nodeList and
concatenate the results into a DOM output stream.

The src attribute is a common property for the img tag. The src
attribute indicates the location of the image source.

The document.write() function adds the script-generated HTML to the
document.

You can use the DOM API function document.createElement(TagName) to
create an element in the current document.

After creating the element, you can use any of a number of functions to
place the element in the appropriate location within the document.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 110. adding new nodes (105) --------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image110.png?raw=true"
   alt="Adding New Nodes"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Examples of these functions include the insertBefore, appendChild, or
replaceChild function that can be used to add the newly created element
into the document.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 111. example: adding a node (106) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image111.png?raw=true"
   alt="Example: Adding a Node"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

This example shows the source code for adding a node to a document.

A new paragraph element is being created that includes a text node with
the string "Hello world!"

The text node is then appended as a child of the paragraph element.

Finally, the entire paragraph with text is appended as a child node at
the end of the body node of the HTML page.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 112. modifying an elements content (106) ---------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image112.png?raw=true"
   alt="Modifying an Elements Content"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The function element.innerHTML retrieves or sets the contents of an HTML
element.

The innerHTML property returns all child elements as a text string.

With the element.innerHTML function, you can change the contents of an
HTML element, by setting it to a text string that can include HTML tags.

Setting the innerHTML value of an element to a string removes all of the
current child elements. The browser then parses the string and sets the
contents of the HTML element.

You can use the element.style method to retrieve or set the inline CSS
style for a particular element.

If you use element.style to set the style of an element, it overrides
any setting from a CSS style sheet with one specific style.

The way to set the style in JavaScript is with the format
element.style.propertyName = value.

For example, if you had an element \<div style=\"color:blue\"\>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 113. modifying the inline style (107) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image113.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Modifying the inline style"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here the \<div\> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with
a color style. You can change the style of this div tag with the
JavaScript statement:

div.style.color = \'red\';

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 114. modifying the inline style (108) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image114.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Modifying the inline style #2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

In contrast, the element.setAttribute(\'style\', ...) wipes out all
previously set inline CSS

styles.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 115. modifying attributes (108) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image115.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Modifying Attributes"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The function element.setAttribute with parameters(attrName, attrValue)
dynamically modifies the attribute of an element.

In the example, the src attribute of an element with an id of theImage
is set to a different target image.

The function element.removeAttribute(attrName) removes an attribute from
an element.

The function element.getAttribute(attrName) retrieves the value of the
specified attribute in the element, if it exists.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 116. window object methods and events (109) -------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image116.png?raw=true" 
     alt=""Window Object Methods and Events" 
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here are some window object functions and events.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------- 117.  window object methods and events #2 (109) ------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image117.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Window Object methods and events"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

To open a new browser window, use the window.open() function.

This method returns a reference to the new window object.

You can use this reference later to close the window, with the
reference_name followed by the close() function.

The parameters of the window.open function are:

URL - A string that indicates the location of the web page to be
displayed in the new window.

You can pass an empty string if you are going to write some script-
generated content to the new window in the current URL context.

Name - A string that specifies the name of the window.

Features - An optional string that specifies the features of the window,
such as its placement and dimensions. The features string is a
comma-separated list of name- value pairs.

Replace -- An optional boolean value. If true, the new location replaces
the current page in the browser history.

The window.onload function can be used to start a function after the
page is loaded.

The function, window.dump(\"message\") writes a string into the console
for the web browser.

The dump() function is a less intrusive way to display diagnostic
information than the alert() method.

Finally, the window.scrollTo(x-value, y-value) scrolls the web browser
to a particular set of coordinates on a page.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 118. example: using window.onload (110) ----------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image118.png?raw=true"
     alt="Example: Using window.onload"
     width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The onload event handler runs in the current window after the document
loads the web page.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------- 119. summary (111) --------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image119.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Summary"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

In the example, the onload event causes an anonymous function to run.
This function, in turn, runs the function addPara().

In this section, you learned:

-   You can retrieve a reference to a node using:

document.getElementById(id) - Returns one specific element that is based
on the id attribute.

document.getElementsByTagName(tagName) - retrieves a of elements with
the specified tag.

-   You can create an element using:

document.createElement(TagName).

-   And place it using:

insertBefore, appendChild, or replaceChild.

-   You can modify elements using:

element.innerHTML to retrieve or set the contents of an HTML element.

element.style to retrieve or set the inline CSS style.

element.setAttribute to modify the attributes of an element.

-   You can manage a window object using functions including:

window.open to return reference to a new window object for the web
browser.

window.dump(\"message\") to write a string into the console for the web
browser.

This is not an exhaustive list -- many more functions exist that enable
you to work with HTML elements and nodes.

In this module, you learned that:

-   JavaScript is a scripting language that enables developers to add
    dynamic content to webpages.

-   JavaScript variables are declared using the var keyword and take
    their type from the value assigned.

-   Program execution is controlled by statements like If...Then...Else,
    Switch, For loops, and While loops.

-   JavaScript uses functions: blocks of code that can be called from
    anywhere in the script.

-   Client-side scripts are programs that accompany HTML documents and
    are used by developers to incorporate more interactive elements.

-   Developers can access HTML DOM elements from JavaScript scripts
    using the correct DOM notation.

-   APIs are often used to access HTML DOM elements in web pages.

include many people -- front-end developers, back-end developers,
database administrators, and repository administrators. Every change by
every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable the changes
to be merged seamlessly, to allow for potential rollbacks, and for
accountability. This type of distributed version control is extremely
important when managing large software projects. Git, GitHub, and Git
Lab are some of the most widely used tools for collaboration, storage,
and version control.

-   List the roles common in large projects.

<h3 id="ch5-2">5.2 Introduction to Git/GitHub</h3>

In this module, you'll get an overview of Git and GitHub, which are
popular environments among developers and data scientists for performing
version control of source code files and projects and collaborating with
others. 

You can't talk about Git and GitHub without a basic understanding of
what version control is. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 120. version control (113) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">

&nbsp;

A version control system allows you to keep track of changes to your
documents. 

This makes it easy for you to recover older versions of your document if
you make a mistake, and it makes collaboration with others much easier. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 121. working without version control (114) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image121.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Working Without Version Control"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Here is an example to illustrate how version control works. 

Let's say you've got a shopping list and you want your roommates to
confirm the things you need and add additional items. 

Without version control, you've got a big mess to clean up before you
can go shopping.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image122.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Working with Version Control"

&nbsp;

With version control, you know EXACTLY what you need after everyone has
contributed their ideas.

&nbsp;

Git is free and open source software distributed under the GNU General
Public License. 

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that users
anywhere in the world can have a copy of your project on their own
computer; when they've made changes, they can sync their version to a
remote server to share it with you. 

Git isn't the only version control system out there, but the distributed
aspect is one of the main reasons it's become one of the most common
version control systems available. 

Version control systems are widely used for things involving code, but
you can also version control images, documents, and any number of file
types. 

You can use Git without a web interface by using your command line
interface, but GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for
Git repositories.

The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer
to another. 

A repository contains your project folders that are set up for version
control. 

A fork is a copy of a repository. 

A pull request is the way you request that someone reviews and approves
your changes before they become final. 

A working directory contains the files and subdirectories on your
computer that are associated with a Git repository.

&nbsp;

There are a few basic <b>Git</b> commands that you will always use. 

When starting out with a new repository, you only need create it once:
either locally, and then push to GitHub, or by cloning an existing
repository by using the command <b>\"git init\"</b>.

<b>\"git add\"</b> moves changes from the working directory to the staging
area. 

<b>\"git status\"</b> allows you to see the state of your working directory and
the staged snapshot of your changes. 

<b>\"git commit\"</b> takes your staged snapshot of changes and commits them to
the project. 

<b>\"git reset\"</b> undoes changes that you've made to the files in your
working directory. 

<b>\"git log\"</b> enables you to browse previous changes to a project. 

<b>\"git branch\"</b> lets you create an isolated environment within your
repository to make changes. 

<b>\"git checkout\"</b> lets you see and change existing branches. 

<b>\"git merge\"</b> lets you put everything back together again.

To learn how to use Git effectively and begin collaborating with data
scientists around the world, you will need to learn the essential
commands. 

Luckily for us, GitHub has amazing resources available to help you get
started. 

Go to try.github.io to download the cheat sheets and run through the
tutorials. 

In the following modules, we\'ll give you a crash course on setting up
your local environment and getting started on a project. 

<h3>Introduction to GitHub</h3>

Welcome to Introduction to GitHub. 

After reading this module, you will be able to: 

-   Describe the purpose of source repositories. 

-   Explain how GitHub satisfies the needs of a source repository. 

Linux development in the early 2000's was managed under a free-to-use
system known as BitKeeper. 

In 2005, BitKeeper changed to a for-fee system which was problematic for
Linux developers for many reasons. 

Linus Torvalds led a team to develop a replacement source-version
control system. 

The project ran in short time frames and the key characteristics were
defined by a small group. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 128. background of git (119) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image128.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Background of git"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

These include: 

-   Strong support for non-linear development. 

(Linux patches were then arriving at a rate of 6.7 patches per second) 

-   Distributed development. 

Each developer can have a local copy of the full development history. 

-   Compatibility with existing systems and protocols. 

This was necessary to acknowledge the diversity of the Linux community. 

-   Efficient handling of large projects. 

-   Cryptographic authentication of history. 

This makes certain that distributed systems all have identical code
updates. 

-   Pluggable merge strategies. 

Many pathways of development can lead to complex integration decisions
that might require explicit integration strategies.

&nbsp;

What is special about the Git Repository model. 

Git is designed as a distributed version-control system. 

Primarily focused on tracking source code during development. 

Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and
support non-linear workflows. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------------- 130. what is git? (121) ------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image130.png?raw=true"
   alt="What is Git?"
   width="75%" />
&nbsp;

Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for distribution of Linux kernels. 

Git is a distributed version-control system that is used to track
changes to content. 

It serves as a central point for collaboration with a particular focus
on agile development methodologies. 

In a central version control system, every developer needs to check out
code from the central system and commit back into it. 

As Git is a distributed version control, each developer has a local copy
of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such
repository to another. Each developer can act as a hub. 

When Git is used correctly, there is a main branch that corresponds to
the deployable code. 

Teams can continuously integrate changes that are ready to be released
and can simultaneously work on separate branches in between releases. 

Git also allows centralized administration of tasks with access-level
controls for each team. 

Git can co-exist locally such as through the GitHub Desktop client or it
can be used directly through a browser connected to the GitHub web
interface. 

IBM Cloud is based on sound and established open-source tools including
Git repositories, often called repos. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image131.png?raw=true" 
   alt="What is GitHub?"
   width="75%" />
&nbsp;

GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. 

GitHub hosted by a subsidiary of Microsoft. 

GitHub offers free, professional and enterprise accounts. 

As of August 2019, GitHub had over 100M repositories. 

A Repository is: 

-   A data structure for storing documents including application source
    code. 

-   A repository can track and maintain version-control. 

-   GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single
    application. 

-   GitLab provides access to Git repositories, controlled by source
    code management. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!--------------------------------- 132. what is gitlab? (123) ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image132.png?raw=true" 
   alt="What is GitLab?"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

With GitLab, developers can: 

-   Collaborate, reviewing code, making comments and helping to improve
    each other's code. 

-   Work from their own local copy of the code. 

-   Branch and merge code when required. 

-   Streamline testing and delivery with Built-in Continuous
    Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). 

In this module, you learned: 

-   GitHub is the online hosting service for Git repositories. 

-   Repositories store documents including application source code and
    enable contributors to track and maintain version-control. 

-   What is special about the Git Repository model. 

-   Git is designed as a distributed version-control system. 

-   Primarily focused on tracking source code during development. 

-   Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes,
    and support non-linear workflows. 

<h3 id="ch5-3">5.3 GitHub Repositories</h3>

Welcome to GitHub Repositories!

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain how to sign up for a GitHub account, and

-   Describe how to create a repository.

-   Signing up for a free, personal account on GitHub is quick and easy.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 133. create an account (124) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image133.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Create an Account"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Start at the GitHub site, https://github.com

You'll need to choose a username, enter your email address and select a
password, then click Sign up for GitHub.

Next, you'll have a short test to prove that you're a person.

Click Verify and solve the puzzle presented.

When you're done, click Join a free plan and then you'll be taken to a
screen where you can select the type of account -- most likely a free,
personal account is all that you'll want.

Choose to set up a personal, free account, which is the default.

GitHub asks some questions about your work, programming experience and
interests.

You can skip these if you want.

Finally, you'll have to respond to an email that you receive which
proves that you linked to GitHub from an account that you access GitHub
provides you with some starting points.

You can choose to create a repository or an organization, or you can
take the Introduction to GitHub course.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 134. create a repository (125) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image134.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Create a Repository"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Remember, a repository is a data structure for storing documents
including application source code which tracks and maintains
version-control.

An organization is a collection of user accounts that owns repositories.

Organizations have one or more owners, who have administrative
privileges for the organization.

Or you can skip this for now and get straight to work.

GitHub provides many resources to help you work effectively. When you
have time, read the GitHub guide.

The heart of a Git-based project is the repository.

This contains all your code and the related artifacts, including things
like:

-   a README file to describe the purpose of the project.

-   A license to express the ways in which people can use your code,
    Etc.

You can also make your repository private (only available to people with
accounts that have permission to see it) or public (searchable and seen
by everyone).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 135. exploring your repository (126) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image135.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Exploring Your Repository"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

When you create your repository, you'll notice that it has a number of
tabs, and is opened to the Code tab.

Code -- this is where all the source files reside.

Git was initially created as a source code repository but now all sorts
of files end up in here.

If you created a README and/or license, that's all that's here right
now.

<i>Issues</i> -- as you continue, you can track and plan with tools such as
"Issues" that lists all open items against your project base.

<i>Pull Requests</i> -- this is part of the mechanism for collaborating with
other users.

Pull requests define changes that are committed and ready for review
before being merged into the main branch.

<i>Projects</i> -- all the tools for managing, sorting, planning, etc. your
various projects.

This is the core of the collaborative power of GitHub.

<i>Wiki, Security,</i> and <i>Insights</i> -- often left for more advanced users,
these tools provide a communication base to the external user community.

<i>Settings</i> -- GitHub allows for a lot of personalization, including
changing the name of your repository and controlling access.

In this section you learned:

-   How to create and verify a GitHub account.

-   Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track
    Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.

<h3 id="ch5-4">5.4 GitHub Branches</h3>

Welcome to GitHub Branches!

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the purpose of branches and

-   describe how to merge changes into branches.

All files in GitHub are stored on a branch.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------- 136. what are branches? (127) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image136.png?raw=true"
   alt="What are Branches?"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

The master branch is definitive; it stores the deployable version of
your code.

The master branch is created by default, however, you can use any branch
as the main, finished, deployable version of the code.

When you plan to change things, you create a new branch and give it a
descriptive name.

The new branch starts as an exact copy of the original branch.

As you make changes, the branch that you created holds the changed code.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 137. how to create a branch (128) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image137.png?raw=true"
   alt="How to Create a Branch"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

To create a new branch, click drop-down branch: master

Add new branch name into new branch text and select Create branch.

GitHub branches can be very complex for large software projects.

For a simple project, such as the ones we are exploring, consider the
following:

Start with a common base, the initial source for this project.

At one point, the code is branched while new features are developed.

In this example, both branches are undergoing changes.

When the two streams of work are ready to merge, each branch's code is
identified

as a tip.

and the two tips are merged into a third, combined branch.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------------- 138. merging branches (128) ----------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image138.png?raw=true" 
   alt="Merging Branches"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Developers work on source files in a branch. Since some projects take a
while, the source doesn't make sense right away.

To change the contents of a file.

1.  Select the file.

2.  Click the pencil icon.

3.  Make the changes.

4.  Commit the changes.

When the developer has completed their assigned work, to save their
changes, they commit the code.

Commit indicates that the developer is convinced that the code
represents a stable platform for the feature or set of features being
developed.

When a developer commits changed source to their path, they are required
to write a comment that describes the changes.

The comment should be meaningful and descriptive.

The developer can choose to commit to the current branch or create a new
branch.

Some rules:

-   Don't end the commit message with a period.

-   Keep commit messages under 50 characters -- use the extended window
    for the details.

-   Always write in an "active" voice.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 139. what is a pull request? (129) ------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image139.png?raw=true"
   alt="What is a Pull Request?"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Pull is used to initiate the merging of branches in a way to capture
changes.

A pull request makes the proposed (committed) changes available for
others to review and use.

A pull can follow any commits, even if code is unfinished.

A pull requires a user to approve the changes. This can be the author of
the change or it can be assigned within the team.

Note that GitHub automatically makes a pull request on your behalf if
you make a change on a branch that you do not own.

Since the log files are immutable, it is always possible to find the
person who approved the merge of the change.

To open a new pull request:

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 140. open a pull request (130) --------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/image140.png?raw=true"
   alt="Open a Pull Request"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Click Pull request and select New pull request.

Select the new branch from the compare box.

Scroll down to view the changes.

Confirm that the changes are what you want to assess.

Add a title and description to the request.

Click Create pull request.

The intent of Git repositories is for the master branch to be the only
deployed code.

Developers can change source files in a branch but the changes are not
released until.

They are committed.

A pull command is issued.

The code is reviewed and approved.

The approved code is merged back into the master code.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------- 141. merged into the master branch  (131) --------------------->

To merge a committed code change into your master code.

Click Merge pull request.

Click Confirm merge.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

   alt="Merge a Pull Request"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

When all changes for a branch are complete, that branch is considered
obsolete and it should be deleted.

In this section, you learned:

-   All files in GitHub exist on a branch.

-   The Master Branch contains the finished, deployable version of the
    code.

-   Create new branches when you need to change the code.

-   The new branch starts as an exact copy of the original branch.

-   As you make changes, the branch that you created holds the changed
    code.

-   More than one branch can be undergoing changes at the same time.

-   Saved changes are called commits.

Pull requests enables other users to review and use the proposed changes
(committed).

When you are ready to merge the changed code into the master branch, you
merge the committed code changes into your master code.

<h3 id="ch5-5">5.5 Cloning & Forking GitHub Projects</h3>

Welcome to Cloning and Forking GitHub Projects.

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Clone and sync repositories.

-   Fork a project to make a base for a new project.

-   Use git commands to communicate with other developers.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 144. team working with github (133) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image144.png"
   alt="Team Working with GitHub"
   width="65%">
&nbsp;

GitHub has over existing 100M repositories, including some very useful
projects.

Whether you are joining a team or basing your own project on prior work,
some of the most powerful tools are forking and cloning a repository.

Cloning generally refers to creating a copy of a repository on your
local machine.

Cloned copies can be kept in sync between the two locations.

Forking allows you to modify or extend a project without affecting the
original project.

Frequently, this is used to take an existing project and make it the
starting point for your new project.

To clone a GitHub repository, navigate to the repository that you want
to clone.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!-------------------------- 145. cloning a github repository #1 (133) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image146.png"
	alt="Cloning a GitHub Repository #2"
	width="65%">
&nbsp;

Under the repository name, click Code.

In the Clone with HTTPS section, click the clipboard button to copy the
URL.

To download the source code, you can click Download zip, but without the
version control information.

On your local machine, open a "Terminal" window and change to the
directory where you want the clone to be copied.

Type "git clone" followed by pasting the URL that you copied above and
then press ENTER to execute the cloning.

When you have made your changes and are ready to sync your code back to
GitHub.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 147. syncing local changes (134) --------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image147.png"
   alt="Syncing a Local Repository"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

First, you must run the "git add " command.

This moves the changed files into a staging area on the GitHub
repository.

The staging area is an area where commits can be formatted and reviewed
before completing the commit.

Next, when you are ready, run "git commit --m " and this will commit
changes

in the staging area.

When you are ready to move your changes fully into the GitHub
repository.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 148. remote repositories #1 (135) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image148.png"
   alt="Remote Repositories #1"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Use the "git push" command.

This will push all the committed changes into the repository.

Remote repositories are repositories that are stored elsewhere -- on the
internet,

on your network, even on your local computer.

You can have several of remote repositories, each of which generally is
either read-only or read/write for you.

Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories
and involves push, pull, and fetch operations to and from them when you
need to share work.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 149. remote repositories #2 (136) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image149.png"
   alt="Remote Repositories #2"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Use git push to transfer your changes to the remote repo.

Use git fetch to transfer any changes from the remote repo to your local
repo.

It does not merge those changes to the branch you are working on. You
can perform a merge manually if you want.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------------- 150. remote repositories #3 (136) -------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image150.png"
   alt="Remote Repositories #3"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Use git pull to transfer any changes from the remote repo to your local
repo, and merge them to a branch.

Developers use the terms upstream and origin when talking about remote
reps.

Origin generally refers to your fork and upstream refers to the original
work.

These are the norms.

You can of course name them anything you like.

<!-------------------------------- 152. forking a project (137) ---------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image152.png" 
   alt="Forking a Project"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Forking is used to take a copy of a GitHub repository and use it as the
base for a new

project.

You can also use forking to submit back changes into the original
repository.

This is also used to independently make changes to a project.

In that instance, when you are satisfied with your changes, submit a
pull request to the original project owner.

They can decide whether or not to accept your updates.

It is often a legal requirement to keep a copy of the of the license
file.

Even if no legal requirement exists, it's good practice.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image153.png" 
   alt="Steps in Forking of a Project"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Navigate to the repository that you want to fork.

In the top-right corner, click the "Fork" button.

To keep a fork in sync with the original work from a local clone.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image154.png" 
   alt="Syncing a Fork of a Project"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

First, create a local clone of the project.

To configure Git to sync your fork:

-   Open a Terminal and change to the directory containing the clone.

-   Type "git remote --v" This gives you the remote repository.

-   Type "git remote add upstream " with the pasted-in directory that
    you used in creating your clone.

Adding upstream adds the original repository as a new remote repository
labelled upstream.

If you type "git remote --v", you'll see the change reflected.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image155.png" 
   alt="Commands for managing forks"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

Other commands of interest include "git fetch upstream" to grab upstream
branches and "git merge upstream/master" which merges changes into the
master branch.

You will also see \"git pull upstream\" used to fetch and merge the
remote branch in the same step.

"Git pull upstream\" reduces the number of steps to sync with a remote
branch, but the automatic merges are not always desired.

In this section, you learned:

-   GitHub has over existing 100M repositories that you can use.

-   You can clone a repository to copy it to your local machine and sync
    changes back to the original repository.

-   You can fork a repository to use it as the base for a new project,
    or to work on a project independently.

<h3 id="ch5-6">5.6 Managing GitHub Projects</h3>

Welcome to Managing GitHub Projects

After reading this section, you will be able to:

-   Understand common roles in a Git project

-   Use git commands to communicate with other developers

A Developer working as a participant in a group project needs to learn
how to communicate with others and uses these commands in addition to
the ones needed by a standalone developer.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!---------------------------- 156. github developer commands (140) ------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image156.png"
   alt="GitHub Developer commands"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

When working with Git, you can use Git commands or a desktop tool such
as GitHub Desktop.

-   git-clone from the upstream to prime the local repository.

-   git-pull and git-fetch from \"origin\" to keep up-to-date with the
    upstream

-   git-push to shared repository, if you adopt CVS style shared
    repository workflow.

-   git-format-patch to prepare e-mail submission, if you adopt Linux
    kernel-style public forum workflow.

-   git-send-email to send your e-mail submission without corruption by
    your MUA.

-   git-request-pull to create a summary of changes for your upstream to
    pull.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image156.png" 
   alt="GitHub Integrator"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

An integrator in a group project receives changes made by others,
reviews and integrates them (responds to pull requests) and publishes
the result for others to use

Integrators use the following commands in addition to the ones needed by
participants.

-   git-am to apply patches e-mailed in from your contributors.

-   git-pull to merge from your trusted lieutenants.

-   git-format-patch to prepare and send suggested alternative to
    contributors.

-   git-revert to undo botched commits.

-   git-push to publish the bleeding edge.

<!------------------------- 158. github repository administrator (141) --------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image158.png" 
   alt="GitHub Repository Administrator"
   width="65%" />
&nbsp;

A Repository Administrator uses the following tools to set up and
maintain access to the repository by developers.

-   git-daemon to allow anonymous download from repository.

-   git-shell can be used as a restricted login shell for shared central
    repository users.

-   git-http-backend provides a server-side implementation of
    Git-over-HTTP (\"Smart http\") allowing both fetch and push
    services.

-   gitweb provides a web front-end to Git repositories, which can be
    set-up using the git-instaweb script.

Repository Admins can use GitHub Actions to automate software workflows,
including continuous integration and continuous delivery.

In this section, you learned:

-   There are multiple roles involved in managing a project:

    -   Developer

    -   Integrator

    -   Repository Administrator

Each role uses different git commands to communicate with collaborators.

<h3>What is Git Bash?</h3>

Git Bash for Windows is simply a package that includes
both <i>Git</i> and <i>Bash</i>.

Git is an open-source version control system for tracking source code
changes when developing software. It keeps a commit history that allows
you to revert to a stable state in case you make errors in your code.
Git also enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same code
base.

Bash is a Unix command-line shell. The name is an acronym
for <i>Bourne-Again Shell</i>. It comes with useful Unix commands like cat,
ssh, SCP, etc., which are not usually found on Windows.

<h3>Installing Git Bash for Windows</h3>

To install Git Bash for Windows to your local system, complete the
following steps:

<h3>What is an SSH key?</h3>

An SSH key is an access credential in the SSH protocol. Its function is
similar to that of user names and passwords, but the keys are primarily
used for automated processes.

<h3>Generating an SSH key</h3>

To generate an SSH key, complete the following steps:

1.  Launch a terminal. If you are using Windows, launch Git Bash.

2.  Type the following command in your terminal, replacing \"\<your email address\>\" with the
    email address that is linked to your Github account. When you have
    typed the command, press Enter.

<b>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"\<your email address\>\"</b>

A new SSH key is generated.

3.  You will be prompted to enter a directory to save the key. You can
    simply press Enter to accept the default location, which is an .ssh
    folder in the home directory. This means you will be able to locate
    the key in \~/.ssh/id_rsa.

4.  You will be prompted to choose a passphrase. You also have the
    option not to create a passphrase. To skip the passphrase, press
    Enter twice to confirm that the passphrase is empty.

5.  <b>Optional</b>: To navigate to the .ssh directory, and check the
    contents of the directory, run the following commands in the
    terminal:

<b>cd \~/.ssh</b>

and then,

<b>ls</b>

When you list the contents of the .ssh directory, you should
see id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the list of contents, where id_rsa is the
private version of your key and id_rsa.pub is the public version of your
key.

6.  You now need to add the SSH key to the ssh-agent, which helps with
    the authentication process. To start the ssh-agent, run the
    following command in the terminal:

<b>eval \"\$(ssh-agent -s)\"</b>

7.  To add the key to the agent, run the following command in the
    terminal:

<b>ssh-add \~/.ssh/id_rsa</b>

Save the file.

<h3>Exercise 4: Check the status</h3>

Run \"git status\" to see info on the modified files.

Let us add the file for committing.

Run \"git add browser-support.txt\"

<h3>Exercise 5: Commit the changes</h3>

<b>git commit</b> will record all the changes into the local staging area.

To commit the changes, you have made, run git commit with a message like
this.

git commit -m \'added a new file browser-support.txt\'

Now all the changes you have made thus far, get committed locally.

<h3>Exercise 6: Push the changes to GitHub</h3>

After you have made all the changes and committed them, it is time to
push the changes to the GitHub.

<b>git push</b> will sync all the changes made till now to your online
GitHub repository.

Run the command \"git push\"

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------- 186. git push (161) -------------------------------------->
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/image186.png" 
	alt="git push"
	width="65%" />
&nbsp;
</p>

Log into your GitHub account and verify if the local changes have
synched.

<h3>Summary</h3>

In this lab, you have learned how to clone a GitHub repository, make
changes to it, commit the changes locally, and push it back to GitHub.

<h3 id="ch5-10">5.10 Chapter 5 Summary</h3>

In this module, you learned that:
<ul>
<li>Distributed version control keeps track of changes to code,
    regardless of where it is stored,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Repositories are storage structures that:
	<ul>
    <li>Hold code</li>
    <li>Track issues</li>
    <li>Enable you to collaborate with others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are
    complete, they can be merged back into the master branch,<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then
    sync changes back to the original.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project,
    or so that the developer can work independently.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Large projects include people working in different roles:
	<ul>
    <li>Developer -- creates code</li>
    <li>Integrator -- manages changes made by developers</li>
    <li>Repository Administrator -- configures and maintains access to the repository</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
